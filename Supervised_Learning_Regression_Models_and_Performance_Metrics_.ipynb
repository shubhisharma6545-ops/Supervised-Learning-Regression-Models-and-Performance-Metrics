        "   - Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y) by fitting a straight line to the observed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "   The model is written as:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Y=a+bX\n",
        "\n",
        "   Y = dependent (response) variable\n",
        "\n",
        "  X = independent (predictor) variable\n",
        "\n",
        "  a = intercept (value of Y when X = 0)\n",
        "\n",
        "   b = slope (change in Y for a one-unit change in X)\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Purpose**\n",
        "\n",
        "   1. To understand relationships\n",
        "\n",
        "      It helps determine whether and how strongly the independent variable affects the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. To make predictions\n",
        "\n",
        "      Once the relationship is established, SLR can be used to predict the value of Y for a given value of X.\n",
        "\n",
        "   3. To quantify the effect\n",
        "\n",
        "      The slope shows how much Y changes when X changes by one unit.\n",

        "   - Key assumptions are:\n",
        "\n",
        "   1. Linearity\n",
        "\n",
        "      The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. Independence of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "      The residuals (errors) are independent of each other; one observation does not influence another.\n",
        "\n",
        "   3. Homoscedasticity\n",
        "\n",
        "       The variance of the errors is constant across all values of X (equal spread of residuals).\n",
        "\n",
        "   4. Normality of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "       The residuals are normally distributed, especially important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "   5. No Perfect Multicollinearity\n",
        "\n",
        "      Since SLR has only one independent variable, this assumption is automatically satisfied.\n",
        "\n",
        "   6. Mean of Errors is Zero\n",
        "\n",
        "       The average of the residuals is zero for all values of X.\n",

        "  β0(Intercept)= The expected value of 𝑌 when 𝑋=0. It represents where the regression line crosses the Y-axis.\n",
        "\n",
        "   β1(Slope)= The change in the expected value of Y for a one-unit increase in X`. It shows the strength and direction of the relationship between \\(X and Y).\n",

        "\n",
        "#5. What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
        "   - It chooses the regression coefficients so that the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values is as small as possible.\n",

        "\n",
        "#6. What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "   - **Logistic Regression** is a statistical and machine-learning method used for classification problems, especially when the dependent variable is binary (e.g., yes/no, pass/fail, 0/1).\n",
        "\n",
        "     Instead of predicting a continuous value, logistic regression predicts the probability that an outcome belongs to a particular class.\n",
        "\n",
        "     **Linear regression**, on the other hand, is used to predict continuous numerical values and assumes a direct linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The key difference is that linear regression outputs any real value and is estimated using the least squares method, while logistic regression outputs probabilities and is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. In summary, linear regression is suited for predicting quantities, whereas logistic regression is designed for predicting categories or class probabilities.\n",

        "#7. Name and briefly describe three common evaluation metrics for regression models.\n",
        "   - Three common evaluation metrics for regression models are:\n",

        "     1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
        "\n",
        "        Measures the average of the absolute differences between actual and predicted values. It shows how far predictions are from the true values on average and is easy to interpret.\n",
        "\n",
        "     2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
        "\n",
        "        Calculates the average of the squared differences between actual and predicted values. Squaring penalizes larger errors more heavily, making it useful when large errors are especially undesirable.\n",
        "\n",
        "      3. R-squared (R²)\n",
        "\n",
        "         Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the model. Values closer to 1 indicate a better fit of the regression model.\n",
        "\n",
        "#8.  What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?\n",
        "  - The purpose of the R-squared (R²) metric in regression analysis is to measure how well a regression model explains the variability of the dependent variable. Specifically, it indicates the proportion of the total variation in the outcome that is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model. An R² value closer to 1 means the model provides a better fit to the data, while a value closer to 0 means the model explains little of the variability. In simple terms, R-squared tells us how effective the regression model is at explaining the observed data.\n",
